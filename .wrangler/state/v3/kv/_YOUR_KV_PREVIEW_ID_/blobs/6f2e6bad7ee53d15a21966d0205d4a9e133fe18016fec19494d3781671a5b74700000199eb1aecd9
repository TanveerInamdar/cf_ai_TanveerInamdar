You can use `console.log()` statements to inspect the data and verify its structure.\n3. **Use null/undefined checks**: Add checks to ensure that the variable or object is not null or undefined before trying to access its properties. For example:\n```javascript\nif (myObject && myObject.hasOwnProperty('propertyName')) {\n  // Access the property safely\n} else {\n  // Handle the error or","usage":{"prompt_tokens":48,"completion_tokens":256,"total_tokens":304}}}
